# lab-1.2
In this repository I upload the following three challenges:

Challenge 1: The code finds the first character that is not repeated in the whole String. For this time the String is provided inside the code. To find it a swept to the given String is performed comparing one character at a time.

Challenge 2: For this program the user types numbers to create a list and the code sorts these numbers, also the user can ask for the median of the given list. In the code a menu is displayed so the user can decide between type a new number, get the current median or leave the execution.

Challenge 3: This program generates a list of non-repeated random integers, using two parameters given, i.e. N and k, N represents the maximum value a number in this random list can take and k represents length of non-repeated random numbers. Ones we have this list, the program generates a random integer which is not in the generated list, all the possible numbers have the same probability of being chosen.

The three challenges where created and compiled in Java at the Eclipse Photon IDE, but where also tasted in the windowsâ€™ command prompt using the Java Virtual Machine.

There were no issues with CPU or memory, the execution time of challenge 2 and 3 highly depend of the circumstances on which they are tasted (for example the time to get randomly a number which is not on the prohibit list is unpredictable) and challenge 1 has a time around 2 and 3 milliseconds.
